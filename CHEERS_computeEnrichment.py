This script computes the disease enrichment of a provided set of SNPs and
writes the output to tab-delimited files. It takes 4 inputs to calculate the
enrichment p-value:

1. Trait name that will be used as a prefix for the output.
2. Directory for result output.
3. Cell type specificity scores that are generated after running 
    CHEERS_normalize.py.
4. A fine-mapped SNP set to test for enrichment. The format is provided below
    and can be generated using generate_mock_dataset.py.

In the original CHEERS implementation, peaks were ranked from 0 to N-1 and the
standard deviation of the uniform distribution was calculated using the floor
of a ratio. This implementation ranks peaks from 1 to N and calculates the
ratio for the standard deviation as a floating point value. If you want to
generate the same p-values that were generated from the original CHEERS
implementation, use the --old_p_values flag.

Usage:
    python3 CHEERS_computeEnrichment.py trait test_output/ test_input/trait_counts_normToMax_quantileNorm_euclideanNorm.txt test_input/snp_list.txt
